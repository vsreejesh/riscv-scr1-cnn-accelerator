# Intro

Welcome to the documentation for my FPGA-based neural network inference accelerator - the logic gate learner!

This project implements a fully working two-layer neural network designed for MNIST digit recognition. It runs entirely on an FPGA using custom Verilog modules and Q1.15 fixed-point math, taking inputs from python via uart.

The whole project has been **designed from scratch** - including the initial neural network - and this documentation will cover everything about the project from the ground up - starting with the basics of a neural network and the math behind it.

I will be covering the project in the order that I implemented it, and in the way I think it is best understood, but feel free to skip to any section that interests you using the links to the left.
